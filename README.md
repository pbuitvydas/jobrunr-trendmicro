# JobRunr example

This repository shows an example how you can integrate JobRunr with [spring.io](https://spring.io/).

## About this project
This project exists out of 3 modules:
- **core**: this project contains [MyService](core/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/services/MyService.java), a simple spring service with two example methods which you want to run in a backgroundserver.  
- **processingapp**: this app is a Spring Console application and runs indefinitely. It polls for new background jobs
  and processes them when they arrive. It contains only a single class
  called [JobServerApplication](processingapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/processingapp/JobServerApplication.java)
  which defines the JobRunr beans to process jobs.
- **webapp**: this is a Spring Rest Webapp that enqueues new background jobs. It contains a simple `RestController`
  called [JobController](webapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/webapp/api/JobController.java) which contains some
  methods to enqueue jobs.

## How to run this project:
- clone the project and open it in your favorite IDE that supports gradle
- Run the main method from the [WebApplication](webapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/webapp/WebApplication.java) in the `webapp` module and keep it running
- Run the main method from
  the [JobServerApplication](processingapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/processingapp/JobServerApplication.java)
  in the `processingapp` module and also keep it running
- Open your favorite browser:
  - Navigate to the JobRunr dashboard located at http://localhost:8000/dashboard. This is running within
    the [JobServerApplication](processingapp/src/main/java/org/jobrunr/examples/processingapp/JobServerApplication.java)
    .
  - To enqueue a simple job, open a new tab and go to http://localhost:8080/jobs/ and take it from there.
  - Visit the dashboard again and see the jobs being processed!
